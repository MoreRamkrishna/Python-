# Tuple Example
# tuple is exactly same operation as list
# tuple is not work in append, remove, pop etc. operation this read only version operation
t = (10,10,30,20,40,10,20,10)
print(t)
print(type(t))  #type operation
print(t.count(10))     #count operation
t.index(20)     # we can show only  first number of index
